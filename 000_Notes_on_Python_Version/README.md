We are assuming Python 3 for this tutorial. If you find any Python 2-isms in the examples, let me know and I'll add your name to the Python 3 Champions list in the Acknowledgements.  

You may find a lot of the literature online draws a distinction between Python 2 and Python 3. You can figure out which version of python you have installed by running

```
$ python --version
```

If it returns `Python 3.x.y` (where x and y are numbers) you're good.

If it shows Python 2, find another tutorial that teaches you to upgrade for your system. Alternatively, try running `python3` instead of `python`.
