Contributions are welcome and appreciated!

A couple of notes:

 * Any code contributed must actually run! No pseudo-code or funcitons that live in an un-callable vacuum.
 * Python 3 only and if you're using features that are only available past a fairly recent version of Python 3, be sure to call that out in some kind of comment.
 * Hacktoberfest contributions are welcome, but please understand that it's unlikely anything you submit on Oct 31 is getting approved by the end of the event.
