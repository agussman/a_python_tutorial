Introduction to Python

The purpose of this tutorial is be an example-drive introduction to scripting in Python.

It's meant to be a crash course, to expose you to the things that are most useful and to explain them in such a way that someone new to programming (or rusty) would get the basic idea. 

It is not designed to teach you to be a software developer, to instill good software development practices, or to educate you on the fundamentals of computer science.

# Recommended Prerequesites:
 * A linux command line
 * a python interpreter
 * a code editor
 * git

You can use [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) to view/edit the code and execute it in a terminal. Get started here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/agussman/a_python_tutorial/master).

# Instructions

 Each directory is a lesson. They will build upon each other conceptually but still run independently.
