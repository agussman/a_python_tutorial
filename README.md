Introduction to Python

The purpose of this tutorial is to teach you the basics of scripting in Python. It is aims to be example driven.

It is not designed to teach you to be a software developer, to instill good software development practices, or to educate you on the fundamentals of computer science.

# Recommended Prerequesites:
 * A linux command line

You can use [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) to view/edit the code and execute it in a terminal. Get started here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/agussman/a_python_tutorial/master).

# Instructions

 Each directory is a lesson. They will build upon each other conceptually but still run independently.
